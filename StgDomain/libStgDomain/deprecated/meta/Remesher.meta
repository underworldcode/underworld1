  <param name="Summary">An abstract class that helps to transform a mesh into a regular, well-formed format.</param>

  <param name="Description">
    Remesher assists with rearranging a mesh into a more regular, ordered format.  Giving
    a mesh a simplified form results in it being easier to deal with.  For example, Remesher
    is useful when a mesh has been advected to such an extent that it is no longer
    well-formed.  A malformed mesh is slower to process and not as representative as a well-formed mesh.
    Remesher is an abstract interface to classes, and therefore does not perform any
    remeshing.  Other classes may be instructed to do the remeshing using a variety of
    remesheing methods.
