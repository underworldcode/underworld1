   The idea here is to stop duplication of components due to repeated including of xml files
   
   For now I am going to include all the VP definitions here, but what I would prefer to do
   is to have the common components defined in this file a little more systematically,
   then the viewports assemble them elsewhere and for the viewports to be included in the window definition file
