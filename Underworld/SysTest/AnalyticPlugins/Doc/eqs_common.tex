  {\large \fontB Basic Equations:}

  The equations governing Stokes' (creeping) flow for an incompressible fluid are given by three sets of equations:
  The first are Cauchy's equations of motion with no inertial terms:
  \begin{equation}
    \nabla\cdot\bm{\tau} + \bm{f} = 0,
  \end{equation}
  where $\bm{\tau}$ is the fluid total stress tensor and $\bm{f}$ is the body force on the fluid.
  The second is the continuity equation for an incompressible fluid:
  \begin{equation}
    \nabla\cdot\bm{v} = 0,
  \end{equation}
  where $\bm{v}$ is the fluid velocity. The third is the constitutive law for the stress tensor:
  \begin{equation}
    \bm{\tau} = -p\bm{\delta} + 2\eta\bm{\epsilon},
  \end{equation}
  where $p$ is the total pressure, $\bm{\delta}$ is the Kronecker delta tensor, $\eta$ is the viscosity and
  $\bm{\epsilon}$ is the rate of strain tensor.
  
  We take the body force, $\bm{f}$, to act only in the $z$ coordinate direction and is given by
  \begin{equation}
    \bm{f} = (0,0,-\rho).
  \end{equation}
