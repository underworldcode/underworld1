  {\large \fontB Description:}
  
  {\bf solF} is a 2-dimensional analytical solution to the Cauchy equations with the acceleration term set to zero
  to represent creeping flow. The boundary conditions are free-slip everywhere on a unit domain. The viscosity is layered with a jump at $ z=z_c $.
  The flow is driven by a dense block.

  {\large \fontB Parameters:}
 
 The variable parameters of this solution are:
 \begin{itemize}
   \item{density parameter: $ \sigma $.}
   \item{viscosities: $\eta_A$ and $\eta_B$.}
   \item{width of dense block: $x_c$.}
   \item{bottom of dense block: $z_c$.}
 \end{itemize}

      Solution ({\bf SolF}):
      This solution has a block of density $\rho = \sigma$ from $0 < x < x_c$ above
      $ z= z_c$.
      The viscosity is layered with a jump at $ z=z_c $.
      The boundary conditions are free slip everywhere on the surfaces of the unit box.}
