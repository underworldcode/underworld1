Error - in Underworld_MovingMesh_CalculateMinOrMaxCoordsOnSidewall(): While calculating new coords to remesh to in axis I for mesh "mesh-linear" with element layout type ParallelPipedHexaEL, found side wall node 6 (with IJK={0,1,0}, local index 6 and coord={0.00,0.20,0.00}) has new coord in remeshAxis of 0.02 (= coord 0.00 + new vel 0.20 in remesh axis * dt=0.10), but already calculated side wall node 5 (local index 180) has new wall coord in remesh axis of 0.00. This would cause irregular deformation, which is not supported for this mesh type. Check your Boundary Condition specifications.
